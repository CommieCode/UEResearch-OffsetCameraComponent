# UE Research - OffsetCameraComponent

This repository provides a custom component which exposes the 'AdditiveOffset' related functions to blueprint.
It includes a sample level (use 'O', 'Shift+O' and 'P').

The solution shows a setup with a custom camera component available, though it should work with UCameraComponent too.

The project uses UE 5.3 but should work with 5.1 or any earlier version including the AdditiveOffset members
